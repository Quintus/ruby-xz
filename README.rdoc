= ruby-xz

<b>ruby-xz</b> is a basic binding to the famous
{liblzma library}[http://tukaani.org/xz/], best known for the
extreme compression-ratio it's native +XZ+ format achieves. ruby-xz gives
you the possibility of creating and extracting XZ archives on any platform
where liblzma is installed. No compilation is needed, because ruby-xz is
written ontop of ffi[https://github.com/ffi/ffi].

== Installation

Install it the way you install all your gems.

  # gem install ruby-xz

== Usage

The documentation of the XZ module is well and you should be able to find
everything you need to use ruby-xz. As said, it's not big, but powerful:
You can create and extract whole archive files, compress or decompress
streams of data or just plain strings.

=== First step

You have to require ruby-xz. Note the file you have to require is named
"xz.rb", so do

  require "xz"
  
to get it.

=== Examples

  #Compress a TAR archive
  XZ.compress_file("myfile.tar", "myfile.tar.xz")
  #Decompress it
  XZ.decompress_file("myfile.tar.xz", "myfile.tar")
  
  #Compress everything you get from a socket (note that there HAS to be a EOF
  #sometime, otherwise this will run infinitely)
  XZ.compress_stream(socket){|chunk| opened_file.write(chunk)}
  
  #Compress a string
  comp = XZ.compress("Mydata")
  #Decompress it
  data = XZ.decompress(comp)

Have a look at the XZ module's documentation for an in-depth description of
what is possible.
