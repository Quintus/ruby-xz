#For this testcase, please note that it isn’t possible to check
#whether the compressed string is equal to some other
#compressed string containing the same original text due to
#different compression options and/or different versions of
#liblzma. Hence, I can only test whether the re-decompressed
#result is equal to what I originally had.
